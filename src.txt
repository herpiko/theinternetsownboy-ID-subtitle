they were very domineering and controlling, homework was kind of a sham[?]
mereka sangat mendominasi dan  mengontrol, PR (pekerjaan rumah) itu sesuatu yang salah

182
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:59,585
I was just like, you know, all the way are penstick[?] together

183
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,440
and force them to do busy work

187
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,700
instead of just regurgitating facts that the teachers told them
ketimbang menelan fakta-fakta yang diceritakan guru-guru mereka

Hak cipta selalu menjadi sesuatu yang membebani industri penerbitan, dan untuk pembacanya

195
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:41,069
but it wasn't an excessive burden
tapi itu bukan beban yang besar

196
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,200
it was a reasonable institution to have in place to make sure that people got paid
masih masuk akal sebuah institusi berada di posisi tersebut untuk memastikan orang-orang dibayar atas hak mereka

197
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:50,100
What Aaron generation experienced was the collision

199
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,560
and this amazing new thing we were trying to build, the Internet and the Web

Saya Aaron Swartz, dan saya di sini untuk mendengarkan Eldred, untuk melihat argumen-argumen Eldred

especially in such a prestigious case as this one

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Lessig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the Internet
Lessig juga sudah bergerak dengan cara baru untuk mendefinisikan hak cipta di internet

210
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
it was called Creative Commons
disebut, Creative Common

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
So the simple idea of Creative Commons is to give people, creators
Jadi, ide sederhana dari Creative Commons adalah membantu orang-orang yang berkarya

a simple way to mark their creativity

with the freedoms they intended to carry
dengan kebebasan yang mereka bawa

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
So copyright is about "all rights reserved"
Jika hak cipta adalah tentang "Hak yang dilindungi"

215
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
then this is a kind of "some rights reserved" bottle[?]
maka ini semacam "Sebagian hak dilindungi"

It's I want a simple way to say to you "here's what you can do with my work"
Saya ingin cara sederhana untuk mengatakan ke kamu tentang "apa saja yang dapat kamu lakukan terhadap karya saya"

217
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,800
even if there are other things which you need to get my permission before you could do
bahkan jika ada hal lain yang kamu butuhkan, yang memerlukan izin

218
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,400
And Aaron's role was the computer part
Dan peran Aaron adalah di bagian komputer

219
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
like how do you architect the licenses
seperti, bagaimana merancang lisensi-lisensi

220
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,300
so that would be simple and understandable and expressed in way that machines could process it
sehingga lebih sederhana dan dapat dipahami dan dapat diekspresikan serta diproses oleh mesin/komputer

221
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
And people are like, why do you have this fifteen year old kid

222
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,000
writing the specifications of creative commons?
menulis spesifikasi Creative Commons?

223
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
like, don't you think that's a huge mistake?
Tidakkah kalian pikir ini kesalahan besar?

224
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
and larry is like: "the biggest mistake that we would have is not listening to this kid"
dan Larry bilang, "Kesalahan terbesarnya adalah jika kita tidak mendengarkannya."

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,200
embarrassing[?] is not even tall enough to get over the podium
memalukan, bahkan dia tidak cukup tinggi untuk berdiri di podium

226
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,300
and it wasn't one of those movable podiums
dan itu bukan podium yang bisa dipindah-pindah

227
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,600
so this embarrassing thing that once he put his screen up nobody could see his face
hal memmalukan lain, setelah layar presentasinya hidup, tak seorang pun bisa melihat wajahnya

228
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,000

and we've got few licences
kita akan mendapati beberapa lisensi

230
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,600
it gives you this list of options explaining what it means
ada daftarnya, masing-masing menjelaskan maksud lisensinya

231
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200

236
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,800
just completely fiberglassed that these adults regarded him as an adult

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Aaron stood up there in front an whole audience full of people

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and just started talking about the platform that he created for Creative Commons

239
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
And they where all listening to him, just
Dan mereka semua mendengarkan dia, pokoknya

240
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,600
I was sitting AT the back thinking: "he's just a kid, why're listening to him?"
Saya duduk di belakang dan berpikir, "dia cuma anak kecil, mengapa kita mendengarkannya?"

241
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
but they did
tapi mereka benar-benar mendengarkan anak ini

242
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
well I don't think I comprehended it fully
Yah, saya tidak benar-benar memahaminya.

243
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Though critics have said that it does little to ensure artists get payed for their work
Meskipun banyak kritik yang mengatakan CC tidak membuat orang-orang dibayar atas kerja/karya mereka,

244
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
the success of Creative Commons has been enourmous
keberhasilan Creative Commons sangat besar.

245
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Currently on the website flickr alone over 200 million people use some form of Creative Commons license
Saat ini, di situs web Flickr sendiri, ada lebih dari 200 juta orang yang menggunakan format lisensi Creative Commons

246

247
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,600

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
He had also diverticolite[?] which was very troubling

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
and we were concerned about him taking his medications.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
He got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail pills everyday

260
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,200
and one of these pills was a steroid which dauted his growth and

261
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,600
made him feel different from any of the other students

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Aaron, I think, shows up at Stanford ready to scholarship

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,600
and find himself effectively in a baby sitting program for overachieving high school-ers

264
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,300
who in four years meant to become captain of industry and one percent-ers

265
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,600
and I think it just made him banana

266
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,900
In 2005 after only one year of college

267
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,210
Swartz was offered a spot at a new startup incubation firm

268
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:36,130
called Y Combinator led by Paul Graham

269
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,192
He's like, "hey, I have this idea for a web site"

270
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:41,876
and Paul Graham likes him enough and

271
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:46,174
so yeah, sure, so Aaron drops out of school to this apartment

272
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,900
So this used to be Aaron apartment when he lived here

273
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:55,163
my big memories of my father telling me how difficult it was to get a lease

274
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,400
cause Aaron had no credit and dropped out of college

275
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,600
Aaron lived in what[?] called the living room

276
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:04,000
and some of the posters here are left over from when Aaron lived here

277
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:08,800
and the library, there were[?] more books then, but a lot of them are Aaron's

278
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,400
Aaron YCombinator site is called "infogami" a tool to build websites

279
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,774
but infogami struggles to find users

280
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,978
and Swartz eventually merges his company

281
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,581
with another Y Combinator project in need of help

282
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,700
it was a project led by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian called "reddit"

283
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:33,680
Now we were starting from almost nothing, no users, no money, no code

284
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,800
and growing day by day into hugely popular website

285
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
and it shows no sign of letting up

286
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,600
first we had a thousand users, than 10.000, then 20.000 and on and on, it's just incredible

287
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:49,207
reddit becomes huge and it's a real sort of geeky corner of the Internet

288
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,100
There's a lot of humor, there's a lot of art

289
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,100
and there's just people who flocked to the site

290
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,500
and made that site the main site they go to every morning to get their news.

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,500
"reddit" kind of just borders on chaos at some level, so on the one hand its a place for people to discuss

292
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,800
...news of the day, technology, politics and issues and yet there is a lot of kind of not safe for work

293
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,800
...material, offensive material. Some subreddits were "trolls", "find a welcome home"

294
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
and so in that sense reddit has been home to controversies as well

295
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
It's kind of sits on the edge of chaos.

296
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,700
reddit catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant "Condé Nast"

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,800
...who makes an offer to buy the company.
reddit catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant "Condé Nast"

298
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
...who makes an offer to buy the company.

299
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,700
Some large amount of money,

300
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
large enough that my dad was getting bugged with questions about like

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,300
"How do I... store this money?"

302
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Interviewer: Like a lot of money
Noah: Like a lot of money

303
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,200
Like... probably more than a million dollars. But I don't actually know.

304
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
And he's how old then?

305
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,200
Nineteen or twenty?

306
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:13,500
So he was in this apartment, they are like sat around on [?] couch hacking on "reddit" and...

307
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,300
when they sold reddit they threw giant party and then all flew out to California

308
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
the next day they left the keys with me.

309
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,800
It was funny you know, he just sold a startup so we all kind of presumed he was the richest person around...

310
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,100
but he.. ah.. he said "Oh, no. I'll take this tiny little shoe box sized room, that's all I need"

311
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,203
...like he was barely larger than a closet.

312
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:42,500
The idea of him spending his money on fancy objects just seems so implausible.
...like he was barely larger than a closet.

313
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,807
He explains it like, I like living in apartments,

314
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,900
so I'm not gonna spend lot of money on a new place to live, I'm not gonna buy a mansion

315
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:49,825
... and I like wearning jeans and t-shirt,

316
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,500
so I am not gonna spend any more money on clothes. So like, it's really no big deal."

317
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,500
What is a big deal to Swartz is how traffic flows on the Internet and what commands our attention?

318
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,800
In the old system of broadcasting you're fundamentally limited by the amount of space in the airwaves.

319
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,500
You know, you could always send out 10 channels over the airwaves for televisions right away

320
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
even with cables you have 500 channels. On the Internet everybody can have a channel.

321
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,800
Everyone can get a blog or a myspace page. Everyone has a way of expressing themselves.

322
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
And so what you see now is not a question of

323
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,800
"who gets access to the airwaves?". It's the question of "who gets control over the ways you find people?"

324
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,500
You know you started seeing power centralizing in sites like Google, these sort of gate keepers that tell you

325
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,500
where on the Internet where you want to go. The people who provides you, your sources of news information.

326
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,500
So it's not you know, only certain people have a license to speak now everyone has a license to speak

327
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
It's a question of "who gets heard?"

328
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,700
After he started working, in San Fransico at Condé Nast, he comes into the office

329
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,500
and they want to give him a computer with all this crap installed on it and say that he can't

330
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,400
install any new things on this computer, which to a developer is outrageous, right?

331
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
From the first day he was complaining about all this sutff.

332
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Gray wall, gray desks, gray noise. The first day I showed up here, I simply couldn't take it.

333
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,800
By lunch time I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying.

334
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,600
I can't imagine staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day, let alone getting

335
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,400
any actual work done. Nobody else seems to get work done either. Everybody's

336
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,800
is always coming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new

337
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
video game system that wired is testing.

338
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,600
He really had different aspirations, that were politically oriented and Silicon valley

339
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,600
just doesn't really quite have that culture that orients technical activity for the purposes

340
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,200
of political goals. Aaron hated working for a corporation. They all hated

341
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,100
working for Condé Nast but Aaron is like the only one who is not going to take it.

342
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,800
And then basically he got himself fired by not showing up to work ever.

343
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,300
It was said to be a messy breakup.

344
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,600
Both Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman declined to be interviewed for this film

345
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,600
He rejected the business world

346
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,100
One of the really important things to remember about

347
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,800
that choice when Aaron decided to kind of leave the startup colture

348
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,100
is that he was also leaving behind the things that made him famous

349
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,400
and well love and, you know, he was at risk of letting down fans

350
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,900
He got to where he was supposed to be going

351
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,500
and had the self-awareness and honorariness to realise

352
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,600
that he had climbed that mountain of shit to pluck a single rose

353
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
and discover that it lost its sense of smell

354
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,100
and rather than sit there and insist that it wasn't as bad as it seemed

355
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,200
and he did get the rose in any event, he climbed down again, which is pretty cool!

356
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,600
The way that Aaron always thought is that programming is magic, right

357
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,400
You can accomplish this things that normal humans can't by being able to program

358
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,800
so, if you had magical power, would you use them for good, or to make you mounts of cash?

359
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,500
Swartz was inspired by one of the visionaries he had met as a child

360
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,000
the man who had invented the World Wide Web: Tim Berners-Lee

361
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,000
In the 1990s Berners-Lee was arguably sitting on one of the most lucrative inventions of the 20th century

362
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,600
but instead of profiting from the invention of the World Wide Web

363
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,300
he gave it away for free.

364
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,400
It is the only reason the World Wide Web exists today

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Aaron is certainly deeply influenced by Tim.

366
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,400
Tim is certainly a very prominent early Internet genious who doesn't in any sense cash out.

367
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,800
Is not at all interested in how he's going figure out how to make a billion dollars

368
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,600
People would have seen "oh, there are money to be made there"

369
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,000
so there would have been lots of little webs, instead of one big one

370
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,400
And one little web and also which doesn't work

371
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
because you can't follow links from one to the other.

372
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,500
Now you had to have the critial mass that this thing[?] was in the entire planet

373
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,600
so is not gonna work unless the whole planet can get onboard.

374
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,500
I am, you know, feel very strongly that it's not enough to just live in the world as it is

375
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,400
to just, kind of, take what you're given and, you know, follow the things that adults told you to do

376
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,300
and, you know, your parents told you to do and that society tells you to do

377
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,100
I think you should always be questioning, you know, I take this very scientific attitude

378
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,800
that everything you've learned is just provisional

379
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,700
that, you know, is always open to recantation or refutation or questioning

380
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,400
And I think the same applies to society

381
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Once I realised that there where real serious problems,

382
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,900
fundamental problems that I could do something to address

383
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,400
I didn't see a way to forget that, I didn't see a why not to

384
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,400
We just started spending a lot of time, just kind of as friends,

385
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,300
We would just talk for hours in the night

386
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,200
I definetly should have understood that he was flirting with me

387
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
I think just to some degree I was like

388
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,300
"This is a terrible idea and impossible and therefore I will pretend it is not happening"

389
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
As my marriage was breaking down and I was really stuck without anywhere to go

390
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,500
we became roommates and brough my daughter over

391
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
We moved in [?] house, it was really peaceful, like, my life had not been peaceful for a while

392
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,800
and really need [?] is

393
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,600
We were extremely close, from the beginning of our romantic relationship

394
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,000
we just, we were constantly in contact

395
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,000
but we were both really difficult people to deal with

396
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,100
In a very Ally McBeal discussion

397
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,700
he confessed we had a theme song and I made him play it for me.

398
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,900
It was "Extraordinary Machine" by Fiona Apple

399
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,900
I think it was just that sense of, kind of, being a little bit embattled

400
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,400
that the song has umm... and it also had like this hopefulness too.

401
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,450
In many ways, Aaron was tremendously optimistic about life.

402
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:42,800
Even when he didn't feel it.
In many ways, Aaron was tremendously optimistic about life.

403
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,560
Even when he didn't feel it.

404
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
He could be tremendously optimistic about life.

405
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,700
Aaron: What are you doing?
Quinn: Flickr has video now

406
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,800
Swartz threw his energy into a string[?] of new projects involving access to public information

407
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,600
including an accountability website called "Watchdog.net"

408
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,800
and the project called the "Open Library"

409
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,400
So the open library project is a website

410
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,300
You can visit openlibrary.org and the idea is to be huge wiki

411
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,920
a kind of website with one page per book.

412
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:23,600
So for every book ever published you wanna have a webpage about it

413
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,831
which combines all the information from publishers,

414
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:29,084
from book sellers, from libraries, from readers

415
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,155
under one site and then gives you links

416
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:34,600
so that you can buy it, you can borrow it or you can browse it.

417
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,173
I love libraries, you know, I'm the kind of person who goes

418
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
to a new city and immediately seeks out the library.

419
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,622
That's the dream of the Open library, building this website

420
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:45,991
where both you can meet from book to book, from person to author

421
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,142
from subject to idea. You go through this vastity[?] of knowledge

422
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,600
that has been embedded and lost in big physical library

423
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,644
that's hard to find, that's not very well accessible online

424
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,586
it's really imporatant because books are our cultural legacy

425
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:01,226
you know, books are the place where people write things down

426
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,088
and to have that all swallowed up by one corporation

427
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:06,222
it's kind of scary.

428
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,737
How can you bring public access to the public domain?

429
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,773
To me sound obvious, that you have to have public access to public domain

430
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:19,410
But in fact is not true. So the public domain should be free to all.

431
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,120
but it is often locked up

432
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:25,500
there's often guard gates, it is just like having national park

433
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,093
but with a moat around it and gun turrets pointed to out

434
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,933
in case somebody might want actually come and enjoy the public domain

435
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,328
One of the things Aaron was particularly interested in was

436
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,306
bringing public access to the public domain

437
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:42,500
This is one of the things that got him into so much trouble.

438
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:52,240
I had been trying to get access to federal court records in the United States.

439
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,906
what I discovered was a puzzling system called "PACER"

440
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,888
which stands for "Public Access to Court Electronic Records"

441
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:07,500
I started googling and that's when I read across Carl Malamud

442
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:14,897
Access to legal materials in the United States is a 10 billion dollar per year business.

443
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:20,097
PACER is just this incredible abomination of government service

444
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,333
It's 10 cents a page, it's this most brain dead code you have ever seen

445
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:29,500
you can't search it, you can't bookmark anything, you got to have a credit card

446
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,848
and these are public records, it's you know US district courts are very important

447
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,400
it's where all our seminal litigations starts, civil right cases,

448
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:42,500
patent cases, all sort of stuff, in journalism students,

449
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,500
citizens and lawyers all need access to PACER and it fights in every step in the way.

450
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:51,857
People without means can't see the law

451
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,040
as readily as people that have that gold American express card.

452
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:57,800
 It's a poll[?] tax on access to justice.

453
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:04,800
You know the Law is the Operating system of our democracy and you have to pay to see it?

454
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,164
Ah. You know that's not a much of democracy.

455
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,964
They make about a 120 million dollars a year on the PACER system

456
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:16,700
and it doesn't cost anything near that according to their own records

457
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,364
in fact, it's illegal

458
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:23,964
the "e-Government Act" of 2002 states that the court may charge

459
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:30,700
only to the extent necessary in order to reimburse the cost of running PACER.

460
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,386
As the founder of public.resource.org

461
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:40,408
Malamud wanted to protest the PACER charges

462
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,786
He started a programme called "The PACER recycling Project"

463
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:47,440
where people could upload PACER documents they had already paid for

464
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,920
to a free database so others can use them.

465
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:53,120
The PACER people were getting a lot of flak from congress

466
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,693
and others about public access and so they put together a system

467
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:01,700
in 17 libraries accross the country that was free PACER access.

468
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,875
You know, that's 1 library every 22,000 square miles I believe.

469
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,700
So wasn't like really convinient...

470
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:11,591
I encouraged volunteers to join the so called ThumbDrive corp.

471
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,782
and download document from public access libraries and upload them to the PACER recycling site.

472
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,271
People take a ThumbDrive as one of these libraries

473
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,026
and they download a bunch of documents and send them to me

474
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:24,853
I mean, it was just a joke

475
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:28,551
In fact when you click on ThumbDrive corps there was a "Widard of Oz"

476
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:31,700
you know the Munchkin singing video clip came up.

477
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,640
But of-course I get the phone call from Steve Schultze and Aaron

478
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,700
saying [?] we would like to join the Thumbdrive corp.

479
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,466
Around that time, I ran into Aaron at the conference

480
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,546
This is something that really has to be a collaboration between a lot of different people

481
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,786
So I approached him and said

482
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,110
"Hey, I am thinking about an intervention on the PACER of problem."

483
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,080
Schultze had already developed a program

484
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:05,911
that could automatically download PACER documents from the trial libraries

485
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,462
Swartz wanted to take a look

486
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:13,653
So I showed him the code and I didn't know what would come next

487
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:18,942
but as it turns out, over the course of the next few hours of that conference

488
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:22,071
he was sitting in the corner improving my code,

489
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:26,515
recruiting a friend of his that lived near one of these libraries,

490
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,653
to go into the library and to begin to test his improved code

491
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,293
at which point the folks at the courts realized something's not going quite according to plan.

492
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:42,311
 And data started to come in... and come in... and come in...

493
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:47,500
and soon there was 760 GigaBytes of PACER docs, about 20 million pages.

494
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,955
Using informations retrieved from the trial libraries,

495
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:57,130
Swartz was conducting massive automated parallel downloading of the PACER system.

496
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:01,500
He was able to acquire nearly 2.7 million federal court documents

497
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,275
almost 20 million pages of text.

498
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,484
Now, I'll guarantee you that 20 million pages had perhaps

499
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,804
exceeded the expectations of the people running the pilot access project

500
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,500
but surprising a beaurocrat isn't illegal.

501
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:19,500
Aaron and Carl decided to go talk to the New York Times about what happened.

502
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,737
They also caught the attention of the FBI

503
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,311
who began to stake[?] at Swartz's parent's house at Illinois.

504
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:31,004
I get a tweet from his mother saying: "Call me"

505
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,520
I thought "What the hell is going on here?"

506
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,560
and so I found [?] of Aaron and you know

507
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,564
Aaron's mother was like "Oh my god, FBI! FBI! FBI!"

508
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:46,133
An FBI agent drives down our home's driveway trying to see if Aaron is like in this room.

509
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,266
and I remember being home that day and wondering why

510
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:53,244
this car was driving down our driveway and just driving back out,

511
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,500
That's weird!

512
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,537
Like 5 years later, I read this FBI file and I'm like

513
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:00,830
Oh my goodness!

514
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:03,153
that was the FBI agent

515
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,192
in my driveway

516
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:08,075
He was terrified, he was totally terrified

517
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:13,623
he was way more terrified after the FBI actually

518
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:16,640
called him up on the phone, tried to suck an amenda[?]

519
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,597
coming down to a coffee shop without a lawyer

520
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,792
He said he went home and laid down on the bed

521
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:23,790
and, you know, was shaking

522
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,750
The downloading also uncovered massive

523
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,141
privacy violations in the court documents

524
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,094
ultimately, the courts were forced to change their policies as a result

525
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:38,875
and the FBI closed thier investigation without bringing charges

526
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:43,068
To this day I find it remarkable, that anybody,

527
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,007
even at the most remote [?]hog field office of the FBI,

528
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,661
thought that a fitting use for taxpayer dollars

529
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:53,049
was investigating people for criminal theft

530
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,581
on the grounds that they had made the law public

531
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,952
How can you call yourself a lawman

532
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,703
and think there can possibly be anything wrong in this whole world

533
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:03,487
with making the law public

534
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:06,263
Aaron was willing to put himself at risk

535
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,800
for the causes that he believed in

536
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:11,336
Bothered by wealth disparity

537
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,440
Swartz moves beyond technology

538
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:15,985
in into a broader range of political causes

539
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:18,738
I went into congress, and I invited him to

540
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,425
come and hangout an intern for us for a while

541
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,035
so that he could learn, you know, the political process

542
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:27,816
he was sort of learning about a new community

543
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:28,865
and a new set of skills

544
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,120
and kind of learning to hack politics

545
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,315
It's seems ridiculous that miners should have to hammer away

546
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:36,423
until they whole bodies are dripping with sweat

547
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,884
faced with the knowledge that if they dared to stop

548
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:40,880
they won't be able to put food on the table that night

549
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,915
while I get to make larger and larger amounts of money each day

550
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,463
just by sitting and watching TV

551
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:48,621
but apparently the world is ridiculous

552
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,242
So, I co-founded a group called

553
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:53,077
the "Progressive Change Campaign Committee"

554
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:56,145
and what we're trying to do is organise people over the Internet

555
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,130
who care about progressive politics

556
00:36:58,136 --> 00:37:00,100
and moving the country in a more progressive direction

557
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:01,624
to kind of come together

558
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,368
join our e-mail list, join our campaign,

559
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,128
help get progressive candidates selected all across the country

560
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:09,264
The group is responsible for igniting the grassroots efforts

561
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,616
behind the campaign to elect Elizabeth Warren

562
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:15,160
He might have thought was a dumb system, but

563
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,512
he came in and he said I need to learn this system

564
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:20,992
'cause it can be manipulated, like any, you know, like any social system

565
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,848
But his passion for knowledge and libraries

566
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,272
didn't take a back seat

567
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,270
Aaron began to take a closer look

568
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:30,488
at institutions that publish academic journal articles

569
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,944
A virtue of being a student at a major US univerity

570
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,920
I assume that you have access to a wide variety of scholarly journals

571
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:41,160
pretty much every major university in the United States

572
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,808
pays these sort of licencing fees

573
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:46,072
to organizations like JSTOR and [?]

574
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,056
to get access to scholarly journals that

575
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,640
the rest of the world can't read

576
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,064
These scholarly journals and articles

577
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:57,240
are essentlialy the entire wealth of human knowledge on-line

578
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,048
and many had been payed for with taxpayer money

579
00:38:00,296 --> 00:38:02,040
or with government grants

580
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,952
but to read them you often have to pay again

581
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,480
handing over steep fees to publishers like Reed Elsevier

582
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,048
These licensing fees are so substantial that

583
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,990
people who are studing in India,

584
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:14,792
instead of studing in the United States,

585
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,704
don't have this kind of access

586
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,096
they're left out from all of these journals

587
00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:22,704
they're left out from our entire scientific legacy

588
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:26,248
I mean, a lot of those journal articles go back to the enlightenment

589
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,600
everytime someone has written down a scientific paper

590
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,200
it has been scanned, digitized and put in these collections

591
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:35,568
that is a legacy that has been brought to us

592
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:38,432
by the history of people doing interesting work

593
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:39,672
the history of scientists

594
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:43,136
it's legacy that should belong to us as commons, as a people

595
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,904
but instead it's been locked down and put on-line

596
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,448
by handful of for-profit corporations

597
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:51,336
then trying to get the maximum profit as they can out of it

598
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:57,288
So, a researcher by the University or the people

599
00:38:57,688 --> 00:39:01,016
publishes a paper and in the very very last step of that process

600
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,480
after all the work is done, after all the original research is done,

601
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,856
the thinking, the lab work, the analysis

602
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:08,232
after everything is done, at that last stage

603
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,744
then the researcher has to handover his or her copyright

604
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,740
to this multi billion dollar company

605
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:15,280
and it's sick!

606
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,864
It's an entire economy built on volunteer labour

607
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:21,008
and then the publishers sit at the very top and scrape off the cream

608
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,704
Talk about a scam

609
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:28,936
one publisher in Britain made a profit of 3 billion dollars last year

610
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:30,184
I mean, what a racket!

611
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:33,944
JSTOR is just a very very small player in that story

612
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:38,544
but for some reason JSTOR is the player that Aaron decided to confront

613
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,720
He gone to some conference around Open Access  and Open Publishing

614
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,352
and, I don't know who the person from JSTOR was,

615
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:49,520
but I think they, at some point Aaron asked the question, like:

616
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,048
"How much would it cost to open up JSTOR in perpetuity?"

617
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,064
and they gave some... I think is 200 billion dollars

618
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,060
something that Aaron thought was truly ridiculous

619
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,888
Working at a fellowship at Harward

620
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,392
he knew users on MIT's famously open and fast network next door

621
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:10,328
had authorized access to the riches of JSTOR

622
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:12,320
Swartz saw an opportunity

623
00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:14,320
You have the key to those gates

624
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,328
and, with a little bit of shell script magic

625
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:19,864
you can get those journal articles

626
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:23,576
On September 24th 2010

627
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:27,112
Swartz registered a newly purchased Acer laptop

628
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,544
on the MIT network, under the name Gary Host

629
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:34,248
the client name was registered as "ghost_laptop"

630
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:38,656
He doesn't hack JSTOR in the traditional sense of hacking

631
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,456
the JSTOR database was organised so

632
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,088
was completely trivial to figure out

633
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,440
how you could download all the articles in JSTOR

634
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:45,560
because are basically numbers

635
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,360
it was basically "/"  "/"  "/"  number article...

636
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:52,630
...444024, and ...25 ...26

637
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,392
He wrote a python script called “keepgrabbing.py”

638
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,072
which, was keep grabbing one article after another

639
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,825
The next day ghost laptop begins grabbing articles

640
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,400
but soon the computers IP address is blocked

641
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,400
for Swartz is barely a bump in the road

642
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,425
he quickly reassigns his computer IP address

643
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,420
and keeps downloading

644
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,625
Well JSTOR and MIT take a number of step to try interfer with this

645
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,525
when they noticed that this was happening

646
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,925
and when the more modest steps don't work in a certain stage they,

647
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,925
JSTOR, just cuts off MIT from having access to the JSTOR database

648
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:33,475
so this is a kind of cat mouse game around trying to get access to the JSTOR database

649
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,825
Aaron ultimately obviously is the cat

650
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:42,075
because he has more technical capabilities than the JSTOR database people defending them

651
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:46,765
Eventually there was a lot[?] of supplies in the basement of one of the buildings

652
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,515
they whent, instead of going through WiFi

653
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,015
he went down there and he just plugged his computer directly into the network

654
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,875
and just left it there with an external hard drive dowloading articles to the computer

655
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:01,900
Unkown to Swartz his laptop and hard drive had been found by authorities

656
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,325
they didn't stop the downloads, instead they installed a surveillance camera

657
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,670
They found that computer in this room in the basement of an MIT building

658
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:18,740
they could have unplugged it, they could have waited for the guy to come back

659
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,640
and say "Dude, what are you doing? You know, cut it out. Who are you?"

660
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,640
and they could have done all this kind of stuff, but they didn't

661
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,905
what they wanted to do was film it to gather evidences to make a case

662
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,825
that's the only reason you film something like that

663
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,575
At first the only person caught on the glitchy[?] surveillance camera

664
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,275
was using the closet as a place to store bottles and cans

665
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,025
But days later it caught Swartz

666
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:11,215
Swartz is replacing a hard drive, he takes it out of his backpack,

667
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,750
leans out of frame for about 5 minutes, and then leaves

668
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:42,150
And then, like, organise a [?] as he was biking home from MIT

669
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:46,400
these cops came out from, like, other side of the road, or something like that, instead of going after him

670
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,000
He describes that he was pressed down and assoulted by the police

671
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,800
he tells me that they... it's unclear[?] they were police

672
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:02,100
that were after someone [?] was trying to attack him.

673
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,350
He does tell me they beat him up.

674
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,500
He was just devastaded.

675
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:14,800
The notion of any kind of criminal prosecution of anyone in our family

676
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,175
was so foreign[?] and uncomprensible, I didn't know what to do.

677
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,315
Well they executed search warrants[?] at Aaron's house,

678
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,775
his apartment in Canbdridge and his office at Harward.

679
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:33,625
Two days before the arrest the investigation had gone beyod JSTOR and the local Cambridge police

680
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:37,150
they had been taken over by the United States secret service.

681
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,400
The secret service begun investigating computer and credit card fraud in 1984

682
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
but 6 weeks after attack on 9/11 their role expanded.

683
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,925
President Bush used the "Patriot Act"

684
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:55,350
to establish a network of what they called "Electronic Crimes Task Forces".

685
00:44:56,575 --> 00:45:01,500
The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.

686
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,865
According to the secret service they are primarily engaged in activities with economic impact,

687
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,400
organized criminal groups or use of schemes involving new technology.

688
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,200
The secret service turns Swartz's case over to the Boston US attorney office.

689
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,915
There was a guy in the US attorneys office

690
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,175
who had the title "Head of the computer crimes division" or "task force"

691
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,515
I don't know what else he had going

692
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,390
but you're certainly not much of a computer crime prosecutor

693
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,365
without a computer crime to prosecute, so he jumped on it

694
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:35,145
kept it for himself, didn't assign to anyone else in the office or the unit

695
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,015
and that's Stephen Heymann.

696
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,650
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann has been largerly out of public view since the arrest of Aaron Swartz

697
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,565
but he can be seen here in an episode of the TV show "American Greed"

698
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,640
filmed around the time of Aaron's arrest

699
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,425
he's describing his previous case against the notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez.

700
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:57,040
a case that gained Heymann enourmous pretentious[?] and accolades.

701
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,025
Gonzalez masterminded the theft of over a hundred million credit card and ATM numbers

702
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:04,325
the largest such fraud in history.

703
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:09,675
Here Heymann, decribing Gonzalez, gives his view on the hacker mindset.

704
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,125
These guys are driven by a lot of the same things that we're driven by

705
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:22,240
they have an ego, they like challege and of course they like money

706
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,875
and everything you can get from money.

707
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:27,665
One of the suspects implicated in the Gonzalez case

708
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,000
was a young hacker named Jonathan James

709
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,115
believing Gonzalez's crimes would be pinned on him

710
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,025
James committed suicide during the investigation.

711
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:41,100
In an early press release describing the government's position in the case of Aaron Swartz

712
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,275
Heymann's boss, US attorney for the disctrict of Massachusetts, Carmen Ortiz said this:

713
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:50,165
Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar,

714
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,750
and wether you take documents, data, or dollars

715
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,100
It's not true. It's obviously not true.

716
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,790
I'm not saying it's harmless

717
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,475
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't criminalise stealing of information

718
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,575
but you gotta be much more subtle in trying to figure out

719
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:13,675
exactly which kind of  harms are harmful here

720
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,525
so the thing about a crowbar is

721
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,742
everytime I brake into a place with a crowbar

722
00:47:19,497 --> 00:47:20,708
I do damage, there's no doubt about it

723
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:23,371
But when Aaron writes a script

724
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,051
that says: "download, download, download" hundreds times per second

725
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,342
there's no obvious damage, to anybody

726
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,462
If he does that for the purpose of gathering

727
00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:35,965
archive to do academic research on it

728
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,057
there's never any damage to anybody

729
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:42,685
He wasn't stealing, he wasn't selling what he got or giving it away

730
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:45,634
he was making a point as for I can tell

731
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,965
The arrest took its toll[?] on Swartz

732
00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:51,314
He just don't want to talk about it, and he's like very stressed

733
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,245
if you thought like the FBI was like, going to come to your doorstep

734
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,982
[?] any time you went down the hall, even to do your laundry

735
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,388
and it would brake in to your apartment,  because you left the door unlocked

736
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:07,177
like, I'd be preety stressed.
And it was clear,

737
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:11,074
And so Aarorn was always sort of, like in, down on[?] mood.

738
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,102
He wouldn't give up any sensitive information

739
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,874
about his whereabouts during this time,

740
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,382
because he was so afraid that the FBI will be waiting for him

741
00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:34,777
It was a time of unprecedent social and political activism

742
00:48:35,737 --> 00:48:39,988
Time magazine would later name as their 2011 person of the year

743
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,337
"the protester"

744
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:46,068
There was a kind of hotbed of hacker activity going on

745
00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:53,817
WikiLeaks had released a trove of diplomatic cables

746
00:48:53,977 --> 00:48:57,040
Manning had been under arrest at the time

747
00:48:57,074 --> 00:48:59,657
it was unknown whether he was the source of the leak

748
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:04,697
Anonymous which is a kind of protest ensemble

749
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,474
that has lots of hackers in its ranks

750
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,440
were going on various spreeze of sorts[?]

751
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:14,205
If you compare that to what he did

752
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:18,091
this stuff should have been left behind for MIT and JSTOR to deal with,

753
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:22,057
in a kind of private, professional matter.

754
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:28,262
It should have never got to the attention of the criminal system,

755
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,731
It just didn't belong there.

756
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,874
Before he was indicted, Swartz was offered a plea deal,

757
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,451
that involved three months in prison, time in a halfway house,

758
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,257
and a year of home detention,

759
00:49:45,348 --> 00:49:47,508
all without the use of a computer.

760
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:52,011
It was on the condition that Swartz plead guilty to a felony.

761
00:49:52,217 --> 00:49:56,480
Here we are, we have no discovery, no evidence whatsoever

762
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,251
about what the government case is

763
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,634
and we have to make this immense decision

764
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:05,794
where the lawyer is pushing you do this

765
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:09,714
the government is giving you a non-negotiable demand

766
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:13,028
and you're told that your likelihood of prevailing is small

767
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:17,485
So wether you're guilty or not you better of taking the deal.

768
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:21,085
Boston has it's own computer crime division

769
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:25,222
lots of lawyers, probably more lawyers than they need

770
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,662
So, you know, you can imagine all sort of cases

771
00:50:28,674 --> 00:50:30,160
where it would be really hard to prosecute

772
00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:33,177
cause you've got some criminals in Russia

773
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:38,260
or you've got some people inside a corporation who are gonna have $500 a hour lawyers

774
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,234
or $700 a hour lawyers sitting down against you

775
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,097
and then you got this case with this kid,

776
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,565
which is pretty easy to prove that he did something

777
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:52,525
and he has already marked himself as a troublemaker with the FBI

778
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,502
so why not go as tough as you can in hearing[?] against that guy?

779
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,805
It's good for you the prosecutor,

780
00:50:57,828 --> 00:51:02,194
it's good for the republic 'cause you're fighting all those terrorist types

781
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,531
I was so scared,

782
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,400
I was so scared of having my computer ceased

783
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,200
I was so scared of going to jail

784
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:10,068
because of my computer being ceased

785
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:13,268
I had confidential material from sources

786
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:15,260
from my previous work on my laptop,

787
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:18,760
and that is above all of my priority

788
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,411
is to keep my sources safe.

789
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:24,697
I was so scared of what was gonna happen to Ada

790
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:27,862
Aaron told me that they offered me a deal

791
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,240
and he finally just said, that he would take it if I told him to

792
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:35,862
and I came real close to saying him "take it".

793
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:42,800
He had this... he had developed, like, serious political aspirations

794
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:46,297
in the intervening time between when, you know, that moment

795
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:51,360
when he ended that entrepreneurial startup life

796
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,171
and begun this new life that had come to this political activism

797
00:51:57,165 --> 00:52:02,765
and he just didn't believe that he could continue in this life

798
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:05,702
with a felony, you know, he said to me one day

799
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,910
we were walking by the white house and he said to me

800
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,800
"they don't have felon work there"

801
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,696
I mean, you know, he really wanted that to be his life.

802
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:25,216
He hadn't killed anybody, he hadn't hurt anybody,

803
00:52:25,256 --> 00:52:27,768
he hadn't like stolen money

804
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,830
he hadn't done anything that seemed felony worthy, right?

805
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:36,800
and, there's this idea that, like,

806
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
there's no reason that he should be labeled a felon

807
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,800
and taken away his right to vote in many states

808
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,784
for doing what he did, like,

809
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,890
that's just outrageous, like, it makes sense for him to be

810
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,208
you know, maybe fined a bunch of money or

811
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,872
you know, asked not to come back at MIT again

812
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,904
but like, to be a felon? to face jail time?

813
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,440
Swartz turned down the plea deal

814
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,824
Heymann were doubled his efforts,

815
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:12,512
Heymann  continued to press us at all, at all levels.

816
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,512
Even with the physical evidences

817
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,100
ceased from Aaron Acer computer, hard drive and usb drive

818
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:21,232
the prosecutors needed evidence of his motives.

819
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:24,696
Why was Aaron Swartz downloading articles from JSTOR?

820
00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:27,160
and just what did he planned to do with them?

821
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,096
The government claimed that he was planning to publish these,

822
00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:36,008
we don't really know whether that was his real intention

823
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,832
because Aaron also had a history  of

824
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:42,768
doing projects where he had analyzed giant datasets of articles

825
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,048
in order to learn interesting things about them

826
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:48,136
The best evidence for that is that when he was at Stanford

827
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:53,192
he also downloaded the whole Westlaw legal database.

828
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:55,824
In a project with Stanford law students

829
00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:58,664
Swartz had downloaded the Westlaw legal database

830
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:00,904
he uncovered troubling connections between

831
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,208
funders of legal research and favorable results.

832
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:07,696
He did this amazing analysis of for profit companies

833
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,040
giving money to law professors who wrote law review articles

834
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:15,072
which would then beneficial to, like, Exxon, during an oil spill

835
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,528
So it was a very corrupt system of funding, you know, vanity research.

836
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:22,680
Swartz had never released the Westlaw documents.

837
00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:25,544
In theory he could have been doing the same thing about the JSTOR database

838
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:27,540
That would have been completely OK.

839
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,976
if he were on the other hand intending to

840
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:33,040
create a competitive service to JSTOR,

841
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:37,064
or gonna set up our own, you know, access to the Harward law review

842
00:54:37,064 --> 00:54:39,060
and charge money for it,

843
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:42,024
then, you know, ok, now it seems like criminal violation

844
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,810
because you're commercially trying to exploit this material

845
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,272
but that's kind of crazy to imagine that's what he was doing.

846
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:49,624
So, but than there's a middle case

847
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:52,720
what if he was just trying to liberate for all of the developing world?

848
00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:55,360
But depending on what he was doing

849
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,648
it creates a very different character to how the law should be thinking about it

850
00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:00,744
the government was prosecuting him

851
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,536
as if this was like a commercial criminal violation

852
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,608
like stealing a whole bunch of credit card records

853
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,840
like it was that kind of crime.

854
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,424
I don't know what he was gonna do with that database

855
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,248
but I heard from a friend of his

856
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,944
that Aaron had told him he was going to analyze the data

857
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,376
for evidence of corporate funding of climate change research

858
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,024
that led to biased results.

859
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:22,752
And I totally believe that.

860
00:55:25,216 --> 00:55:27,848
I was just told that Steve wanted to talk to me.

861
00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:32,896
and I tought maybe this is a way I can get out of this.

862
00:55:33,136 --> 00:55:35,016
just to exit the situation.

863
00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:37,824
I didn't want to leave in fear to having my computer ceased

864
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,032
I didn't want to leave in fear to having to go to jail

865
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:43,030
on a contempt of court charge if

866
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,296
they tried to compel me to decrypt my computer

867
00:55:46,616 --> 00:55:49,456
when they came to me and said: "Steve wants to talk to you"

868
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,208
that seemed reasonable.

869
00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:54,760
They offered Norton what is known as

870
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,296
a "Queen for a day" letter or a proffer

871
00:55:57,576 --> 00:56:00,728
it allowed prosecutors to ask questions about Aaron's case.

872
00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:03,848
Norton would be given immunity from prosecution herself

873
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,240
for any information she revealed during the meeting.

874
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,432
I didn't like it

875
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,608
I told my lawyers repeadetly that I didn't...

876
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,712
this seemed de[?], I didn't like ithis

877
00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:14,616
I didn't want immunity, I didn't need immunity

878
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,112
I hadn't done anything.

879
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,000
But they were really really stringent

880
00:56:18,032 --> 00:56:21,696
thay did not want me meeting the prosecutor without immunity.

881
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,928
Interviewer: just to make clear, this is a queen for a day deal proffer

882
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,920
Right a proffer letter

883
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,224
Interviewer: In which you basically handed information over them

884
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,312
in exchange for protection from prosecution.

885
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,592
So, it wasn't handing information over,

886
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:36,304
it was, at least this was how I saw, it was just

887
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:38,232
having a discussion, having an inteview with them

888
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:41,040
Interviewer: Well, they're asking you questions
Quinn: They're asking me questions

889
00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:42,144
Interviewer: They are asking about what they want
Quinn: Right

890
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,288
Interviewer: and whatever they learned [?] prosecute for that

891
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:49,352
Right, I really... right, and I repeadetly tried to go in naked

892
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,536
I repeadetly tried to turn down the proffer letter

893
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,520
I was ill, I was being pressured by my lawyers,

894
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,712
I was confused.

895
00:56:57,896 --> 00:57:01,208
I was not doing well by this point

896
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:02,992
I was depressed, and I was scared,

897
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:05,648
and I didn't understand the situation I was in.

898
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,888
I had no idea why I was in this situation

899
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,312
I hadn't done anything intresting much less wrong.

900
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:14,800
[?] over minds[?]

901
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:17,024
Aaron was clearly very destroyed about it

902
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,624
we were very destroyed about it

903
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:20,952
Aaron attorneys were very destroyed about it

904
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,432
we tried to get Quinn to change attorneys

905
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:28,112
I was very unused to be in a room with large man, well armed,

906
00:57:28,672 --> 00:57:30,600
that are continuosly telling me I'm lying

907
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:32,360
and I must have done something

908
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:36,504
I told them that this thing that they were prosecuting

909
00:57:37,184 --> 00:57:39,936
wasn't a crime,

910
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,224
I told them that they were on the wrong side of history

911
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:44,528
I used that phrase, I said:

912
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:46,520
"you're on the wrong side of history"

913
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:49,672
And they were bored,

914
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:51,670
they didn't look angry, they just looked bored

915
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:55,220
and I begun... it occured to me that

916
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,304
we weren't having the same conversation

917
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,384
I mean, I told them plenty of things about, you know,

918
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,688
why people would donwload journal articles, and eventually

919
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,768
I don't remember what was around it

920
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,400
I mentioned he had done this blog post

921
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,008
"the guerilla open access manifesto"

922
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:15,608
This is the guerilla open access manifesto

923
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,704
supposedly written in July 2008, in Italy

924
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,560
Information is power.

925
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:22,816
But like all power,

926
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,872
there are those who want to keep it for themselves.

927
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,264
The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage,

928
00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:29,496
published over centuries in books and journals,

929
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:32,064
is increasingly being digitized and locked up

930
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,060
by a handful of private corporations.

931
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,096
Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by.

932
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,496
You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences,

933
00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,614
liberating the information locked up by the publishers

934
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,856
and sharing them with your friends.

935
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,424
But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground.

936
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:49,216
It's called stealing or piracy,

937
00:58:49,344 --> 00:58:52,142
as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of

938
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,368
plundering a ship and murdering its crew.

939
00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:57,592
But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative.

940
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,088
Only those blinded by greed

941
00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:01,320
would refuse to let a friend make a copy.

942
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:04,448
There is no justice in following unjust laws.

943
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,264
It's time to come into the light and,

944
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:08,328
in the grand tradition of civil disobedience,

945
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:11,504
declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.

946
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:16,392
The manifesto itself was allegedly written by four different people

947
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:18,390
and also edited by Norton

948
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,168
but it was Swartz who had signed his name to it.

949
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:25,248
When it's over, I go immediately to Aaron

950
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,616
and tell him everything I can remember about it

951
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:30,384
and he gets very angry

952
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,208
The things that I'he done shouldn't have added up that way

953
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,808
I hadn't done anything wrong

954
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:45,224
and everything had gone wrong

955
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:48,216
but I was never...

956
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:58,664
I'm still angry
Saya masih marah

957
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:01,864
I'm still angry...
Saya masih marah

958
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,728
...try your best with these people to do the right thing
...cobalah yang terbaik kepada orang-orang ini untuk melakukan hal yang benar

959
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,576
and they turn everything against you
dan mereka akan mengubah segalanya terhadapmu

960
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,888
and they will hurt you with anything they can
dan mereka akan menyakitimu dengan apapun yang mereka bisa

961
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,816
and, in that moment, I regret that I said what I did
dan, pada saat itu, saya menyesal mengatakan apa yang saya lakukan

962
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:23,216
but my larger regret is that we've settled for this
tapi penyesalan yang lebih besar adalah kita tetap bertahan untuk ini

963
01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:25,432
that we're OK with this
kita baik-baik saja dengan ini

964
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,968
that we're ok with a justice system which [?] tries to game people
bahwa kita baik-baik saja dengan sistem peradilan yang [?] mencoba untuk mempermainkan orang

965
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,568
into like traps so that they can ruin their lives
kedalam semacam jebakan, kemudian mereka mengancurkan hidup mereka

966
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:35,032
So, yeah, I wish I hadn't said that
Jadi, ya, saya harap saya tidak harus mengatakannya

967
01:00:35,272 --> 01:00:41,104
but I'm much much angrier that this is where I am
tapi saya sangat sangat marah karena ini terjadi pada saya

968
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:46,880
That this is what we as people think is OK
karena kita pikir ini baik-baik saja

969
01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:52,232
They used every method that I think they could think of
Mereka metode apapun yang saya pikir mereka bisa pikirkan

970
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:55,168
to get her to provide information which would be
untuk memaksa dia untuk memberikan informasi yang mungkin

971
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,200
unhelpful to Aaron, and helpful to the prosecution of Aaron
tidak membantu Aaron, tapi membantu penuntutan Aaron

972
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:06,581
But, you know, I don't think she had information that was helpful to the government.
Tapi, ya, saya tidak berfikir dia mempunyai informasi yang bisa membantu pemerinrah.

973
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:12,000
Months go by as Swartz's friends and family await a looming indictment.
Bulan ke bulan berlalu sebagai teman Swartz dan keluarga menunggu -------------

974
01:01:12,426 --> 01:01:17,376
In the meantime, Swartz was becoming a goto expert on a series of Internet issues.
Sementara itu, Swartz telah menjadi seorang ahli ------------- pada serangkaian masalah Internet.

975
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,036
Do you think that the Intenet is something that should be considered a human right
Apakah Anda berpikir bahwa internet adalah sesuatu yang harus dianggap sebagai hak asasi manusia

976
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:24,580
something that the government can not take away from you.
sesuatu yang tidak bisa direnggut oleh pemerintah darimu.

977
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,967
Yes. Definitely.
Ya. Tentu.

978
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:30,458
There is this notion that national security is an excuse to shut down the Internet.
Ada pendapat bahwa keamanan nasional adalah alasan untuk menutup Internet.

979
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:34,016
that's exactly what we heard in Egypt, Syria and these other countries.

980
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,141
and so its true, sites like WikiLeaks are going to be putting up

981
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:39,810
some embarassing material about what what the US govt does.

982
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:42,506
and people are going to be organizing to protest about it

983
01:01:42,516 --> 01:01:43,800
and try and change the government.

984
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:46,160
You know, that's a good thing.

985
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,225
Thats what all these First Amendment rights of free expression,

986
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:49,950
freedom of association are all about.

987
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,341
and so the notion that we should try and shut them down

988
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,061
I think, just goes against very basic American principles.

989
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,100
a principle, I think, is one that our founding fathers would have understood.

990
01:01:58,138 --> 01:01:59,716
If the Internet would have been around back then

991
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:03,345
instead of putting Post Offices in the constituion they would have put ISPs.

992
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:10,261
Swartz meets activist Taren Steinbrickner-Kauffman and the two begin to date.

993
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,437
...in a massive public outcry.

994
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,616
There is no massive global public outcry. It won't create any change.

995
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:18,930
You know, 4 people in this city should cause a massive global public outcry.

996
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:22,140
You know, we need a petition signer.

997
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,196
Without telling her specifics, he warned her

998
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:27,690
he was involved in something he called simply "the bad thing".

999
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,876
And I had, sort of, crazy theories, like

1000
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:32,340
that he was having an affair with Elizabeth Warren or

1001
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,776
I speculated both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren.

1002
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,767
So sometime in probably late July Aaron called me

1003
01:02:42,356 --> 01:02:44,480
and I happen to pick up and he said:

1004
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,476
"The bad thing might be in the news tomorrow"

1005
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:49,629
"Do you want me to tell you or do you want to read about it in the news".

1006
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:51,520
and I said: "I want you to tell me."

1007
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:58,654
and he said: "Well I have been arrested"

1008
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,800
"for downloading too many academic journal articles"

1009
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,440
"and they want to make an example out of me."

1010
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,906
and I was like: "That's it! That's the big fuss! Really?"

1011
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:11,120
"it doesn't sound like a very big deal."

1012
01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:17,632
On  July 14th, 2011, Federal prosecutors indict Swartz on 4 felony counts.

1013
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,613
He gets indicted

1014
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:24,110
On the same day 2 people in England who are part of LulzSec get arrested

1015
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,995
and few other real hackers

1016
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:29,920
and Aaron is just someone who kind of looks like a hacker

1017
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,082
enough that, they can like, put his head on the stakes and put it on the gates.

1018
01:03:35,317 --> 01:03:38,794
Aaron went to surrender and they arrested him.

1019
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:42,336
they then strip searched him.

1020
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,137
took away his shoelaces, took away his belt

1021
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:47,520
and left him in solitary confinement.

1022
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:52,906
The District of Massachusetts, United States Attorney's Office

1023
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:54,862
released a statement saying:

1024
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,795
"Swartz faces up to 35 yrs in prison

1025
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,568
to be followed by 3 yrs of supervised release

1026
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:05,350
restitution, forefeiture and a fine of upto $1 million dollars."

1027
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:09,130
He was released on a $100,00 bail.

1028
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,417
The same day, the primary victim in the case JSTOR

1029
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,217
formally drops all charges against Swartz and declines to pursue the case.

1030
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:21,635
JSTOR, they weren't our friends. They weren't helpful or friendly to us

1031
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:24,755
but they also were just kind of like "We are not part of this"

1032
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,555
JSTOR, and their parent company Ithica

1033
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:30,780
also sidestepped request to talk for the film.

1034
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,324
aut at the time they released a statement saying

1035
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:36,942
it was the goverment's decision weather to prosecute, not JSTOR's

1036
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:42,304
And so it was our belief that with that the case would be over.

1037
01:04:42,675 --> 01:04:45,350
that we should be able to get Stephen Heymann to drop the case.

1038
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:48,170
or settle in some rational way.

1039
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:50,133
and the government refused.

1040
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,050
Interviewer: Why?

1041
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:58,017
Well, because I think, they wanted to make an example out of Aaron

1042
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:03,200
and they said the reason why they wouldnt move on,

1043
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:05,413
requiring a felony conviction and jail time

1044
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:12,190
was that they wanted to use this case as a case for deterrence.

1045
01:05:12,192 --> 01:05:13,301
They told us that.

1046
01:05:13,395 --> 01:05:14,168
Interviewer: They told you that?

1047
01:05:14,222 --> 01:05:15,000
Yes.

1048
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:17,324
Interviewer: This was gonna be an example?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

1049
01:05:17,386 --> 01:05:21,870
Interviewer: He was gonna be an example?
Aaron's Father: Yes. Stephen Heymann said that.

1050
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:23,413
Deterring who?

1051
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:26,497
Like is a lot of people running around and loggin onto JSTOR

1052
01:05:26,515 --> 01:05:29,680
and downloading the artcles to make a political statement, I mean, who are they deterring.

1053
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,502
It would be easier to understand the Obama Administration's posture

1054
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,853
of supposedly being for deterrence if this had been Adminsitration that, for instance

1055
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,795
prosecuted arguably the biggest economic crime this country has seen in the last 100 yrs

1056
01:05:45,893 --> 01:05:49,370
the crimes that were committed that led to the financial crisis on Wall St.

1057
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:58,310
When you start deploying the non-controversial idea of deterrence only selectively,

1058
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,964
you stop making a dispassionate analysis of law breaking

1059
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,417
and you started deciding to deploy law enforcement resources

1060
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,151
specifically on the basis of political ideology

1061
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:15,570
and thats not just un-democratic it is supposed to be un-American.

1062
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,875
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann later reportedly told MIT's outside counsel

1063
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:27,422
that the straw that broke the camel's back was a press release

1064
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:31,240
sent out by an organization Swartz founded called "Demand Progress".

1065
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,120
According to the MIT account

1066
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:35,777
Heymann reacted to the short statement of support

1067
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:38,186
calling it a wild Internet campaign

1068
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:44,160
and a foolish move that moved the case from human one-on-one level to an institutional level.

1069
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,622
That was a poisnous combination.

1070
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:51,137
A prosecutor who didn't want to lose face, who had a political carrer in the offing may be

1071
01:06:51,244 --> 01:06:53,448
and didn't want to have this to come back and haunt them.

1072
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:57,617
you spent how many tax dollars arresting someone for taking too many books out of the library

1073
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:00,970
and got your ass handed to you in court. No way!

1074
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,648
I then moved to try and put pressure on MIT in various ways

1075
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:06,355
to get them to go to the government

1076
01:07:06,391 --> 01:07:10,071
and request the government to stop the prosecution.

1077
01:07:11,217 --> 01:07:13,360
Interviewer: What was MIT's reaction then?

1078
01:07:14,275 --> 01:07:17,520
There doesn't seem to be any reaction from MIT at that point.

1079
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,724
MIT doesn't defend Aaron,

1080
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:30,497
which to people inside of MIT community seems outrageous,

1081
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:35,700
because MIT is a place that encourages hacking in the biggest sense of the word.

1082
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,715
At MIT the idea of going and running around in routes and tunnels

1083
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:43,457
that you weren't allowed to be in, was not only a rite of passage,

1084
01:07:43,733 --> 01:07:45,870
it was part of the MIT tour,

1085
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:49,952
,nd lock picking was a winter course at MIT.

1086
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:56,074
They had the moral authority to stop it in its tracks.

1087
01:07:56,186 --> 01:08:00,780
MIT never stood up and took a position of saying to the Feds:

1088
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,902
"Don't do this. We dont want you to do this

1089
01:08:03,937 --> 01:08:07,280
you are over reacting, this is too strong" , that I'm aware of.

1090
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,506
They acted kind of like any corporation would.

1091
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:15,680
They helped the government and they didn't help us,

1092
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:21,418
unless they felt that they had to and they never tried to stop it.

1093
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:25,216
MIT declined repeated requests to comment.

1094
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:30,208
but they later released a report saying that they attempted to maintain a position of neutrality

1095
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:35,520
and believed Heymann and US Attorney's office did not care what MIT thought or said about the case.

1096
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:41,472
MIT's behaviour seemed really at odds with the MIT ethos.

1097
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:47,274
You could argue that MIT turned a blind eye and that was okay for them to do

1098
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:52,757
but taking that stance, taking that neutral stance in itself was taking a pro-prosecutor stance.

1099
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:58,922
If you look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniack, they started by selling a bluebox

1100
01:08:58,922 --> 01:09:01,610
which was a thing designed to defraud the phone company.

1101
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,506
If you look at Bill Gates and Paul Allen,

1102
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:08,728
they initially started their buisness by using computer time at Harvard

1103
01:09:08,826 --> 01:09:11,093
which was pretty clearly against the rules.

1104
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,431
Difference between Aaron and people that I just mentioned

1105
01:09:13,466 --> 01:09:16,690
is that Aaron wanted to make the world a better place, he didn't want to just make money.

1106
01:09:19,244 --> 01:09:23,300
Swartz continues to be outspoken on variety of Internet Issues.

1107
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:28,590
You know  the reason Internet works is because of the competitive marketplace of ideas.

1108
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,804
and what we need to be focussing on is getting more information about our government

1109
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:34,540
more accessability, more discussion, more debate.

1110
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:38,261
aut instead it seems, what Congress is foccussed on is shutting the things down,

1111
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:40,426
Aaron thought that he could change the world

1112
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:44,071
just by explaining the world very clearly to people.

1113
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,920
FLAME can literally control your computer and make it spy on you.

1114
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,020
Welcome Aaron, good to have you back on the show here.

1115
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,106
You know, just like spies used to, in olden days,

1116
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:56,373
put microphones and tap what people are saying,

1117
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:58,784
now they are using computers to do the same things.

1118
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:01,621
Swartz's political activity continues,

1119
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:06,840
his attention turning to a bill moving through Congress designed to curb online piracy.

1120
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,896
It was called SOPA.

1121
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,951
Activists like Peter Eckersley saw it as an enormous over reach,

1122
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,884
threatening the technical integrity of Internet itself.

1123
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:18,218
In one of the first things I did was to call Aaron,

1124
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,900
and I said can we do a big online campaign against this,

1125
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:24,040
This isn't a bill about copyright,

1126
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:25,941
It's not?

1127
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,930
No, he said. It's a bill about the freedom to connect.

1128
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:31,671
Now I was listening.

1129
01:10:32,177 --> 01:10:35,608
And he thought about it for a while and then said yes,

1130
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:38,008
and he went and founded Demand Progress.

1131
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,693
Demand Progress in an online activism organization.

1132
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,240
We got around a million and half member now.

1133
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:47,182
But started in the fall on 2010.

1134
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:49,306
Aaron was one of the most prominent people

1135
01:10:49,342 --> 01:10:51,937
in a community of people who helped lead organizing

1136
01:10:52,053 --> 01:10:55,330
around social justice issues at the federal level in this country.

1137
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,440
SOPA was the bill that was intended to curtail online piracy of music and movies,

1138
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,897
but what it did was basically take a sledge hammer

1139
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:07,060
to a problem that needed a scalpel.

1140
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:11,795
If passed the law would allow a company to cut off finances to entire websites

1141
01:11:11,928 --> 01:11:16,650
without due process or even to force Google to exclude their links

1142
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:20,448
all they needed was a single claim of copyright infringment.

1143
01:11:20,808 --> 01:11:23,884
It pitted the titans of traditional media against the new

1144
01:11:23,928 --> 01:11:26,720
and now far more sophisticated remix culture.

1145
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,222
It makes everyone who runs a website into a policeman

1146
01:11:30,382 --> 01:11:33,013
and if they don't do their job of making sure that nobody on their site

1147
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:35,422
uses it for anything that even potentially illegal

1148
01:11:35,653 --> 01:11:38,480
the entire site could get shutdown without even so much as a trial.

1149
01:11:38,622 --> 01:11:43,500
This was over the top. I mean, this was a catostrophy.

1150
01:11:43,706 --> 01:11:49,310
This bill poses a serious threat to speech and civil liberties

1151
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:51,570
for all who use the Internet.

1152
01:11:51,626 --> 01:11:55,848
Only handful of us who said: "Look we are not for piracy either

1153
01:11:56,293 --> 01:11:58,906
but it makes no sense to destory the architecture of the Internet,

1154
01:11:59,084 --> 01:12:03,466
the domian name system and so much that makes it free and open

1155
01:12:03,591 --> 01:12:06,080
in the name of fighting piracy

1156
01:12:06,142 --> 01:12:07,591
and Aaron got that right away.

1157
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,617
The freedoms guaranteed in our constitution,

1158
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:13,840
freedoms our country has been built on would be suddenly deleted.

1159
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:16,728
New technology instead of bringing us greater freedom

1160
01:12:16,942 --> 01:12:20,130
would have snuffed out fundamental rights we had always taken for granted.

1161
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:26,850
and I realized that day talking to Peter, that I couldn't let that happen.

1162
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:33,360
When SOPA was introduced in October 2011 it was considered inevitable

1163
01:12:33,422 --> 01:12:37,350
our strategy when it first came out was to hopefully slow the bill down

1164
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,573
maybe weaken it a little bit,

1165
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,355
but even we didn't think that we would be able to stop this bill.

1166
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,431
Having worked in Washington what you learn is that

1167
01:12:49,982 --> 01:12:53,377
typically in Washington the legislative fights

1168
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:57,760
are fights between different sets of corporate money interests.

1169
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,613
and all duking it out to pass legislations

1170
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:04,995
and the fights that are the closest are when you have one set of corporate interest

1171
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:08,130
against another set of corporate interests and they are financially

1172
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:11,160
equally matched in terms of campaign contributions and lobbying.

1173
01:13:11,168 --> 01:13:12,661
Those are the closest ones.

1174
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,395
The ones that aren't even fights, typically,

1175
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:18,440
are ones where all the money is on one side

1176
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,346
all the corporations are on one side,

1177
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:22,850
and its just millions of people are on the other side.

1178
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:30,560
I haven't seen anything like PIPA and SOPA in all my time in public service,

1179
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:36,832
there were more than 40 United States senators on that bill as co-sponsers.

1180
01:13:37,557 --> 01:13:43,744
so there were already a long long way to getting 60 votes to clear all the procedural hoops.

1181
01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:48,010
Even I began to doubt myself. It was a rough period.

1182
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:51,697
Swartz and Demand Progress were able to marshall enormous support

1183
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:56,168
using traditional outrage combined with commonly used Voice over IP

1184
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:59,182
to make it very easy for people to call Congress.

1185
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:03,857
I've never met anybody else who was able to operate at his level,

1186
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:08,320
both on the technological side and on the campaign strategy side.

1187
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:12,577
Millions of people contacted Congress and signed anti-SOPA petitions.

1188
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,970
Congress was caught off guard.

1189
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:20,231
There was just something about watching those clueless member of Congress debate the bill,

1190
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,791
watching them insist they could regulate the Internet

1191
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,951
and a bunch of nerds couldn't possibly stop them.

1192
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,071
I'm not a nerd.

1193
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,640
I am just not enough of a nerd.

1194
01:14:27,688 --> 01:14:30,737
...maybe we ought to ask some nerds what this thing really does.

1195
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:32,896
Let's have hearing, bring in the nerds.

1196
01:14:35,617 --> 01:14:36,390
Really?

1197
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,031
Nerds?

1198
01:14:42,088 --> 01:14:45,546
You know, I think actually the word you are looking for is "Experts".

1199
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:53,290
to enlighten you, so your laws won't backfire, break the Internet.

1200
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:56,702
We used the term Geek, but we are allowed to use that because we are geeks.

1201
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,880
The fact that it got as far as it did without them talking to any technical experts

1202
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:04,704
reflects the fact that there is a problem in this town.

1203
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:10,115
I'm looking for somebody to come before this body and testify in a hearing

1204
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,080
and say this is why they are wrong.

1205
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,484
There used to be an office that provided Science and Technology advice

1206
01:15:15,546 --> 01:15:19,480
and members could go to them and say "Help me understand XYZ".

1207
01:15:19,488 --> 01:15:22,069
and Gingrich killed it. He said it was waste of money.

1208
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:25,717
Ever since then Congress has plunged into the dark ages.

1209
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:29,850
I don't think anybody thought that SOPA could be beaten, including Aaron.

1210
01:15:30,222 --> 01:15:34,053
He knew it was worth trying but it doesn't seem winnable.

1211
01:15:34,506 --> 01:15:37,130
And I remember, maybe a few months later, I remember him

1212
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:40,030
just turning to me and being like "I think we might win this"

1213
01:15:40,394 --> 01:15:42,250
and I was like "That would be amazing"

1214
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:50,222
Calls to Congress contiune when Domain hosting site GoDaddy becomes a supporter of the bill.

1215
01:15:50,248 --> 01:15:54,920
tens of thousands of users transfer their Domain Names in protest.

1216
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:59,650
Within a week, a humbled GoDaddy reverses their position on SOPA.

1217
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:04,453
About when the Congress people that supported these

1218
01:16:04,471 --> 01:16:08,320
the record and movie industries realize that there was this backlash

1219
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:10,364
they kind of scaled the bill back a little bit,

1220
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,644
you could see the curve happening.

1221
01:16:11,688 --> 01:16:15,890
you could see that our arguments were starting to resonate.

1222
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,980
It was like Aaron had been like striking a match and he was being blown out...

1223
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:20,864
striking another one and being blown out and finally

1224
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,071
he managed to catch enough kindling that the flame actually caught

1225
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,873
and then they turned into this roaring blaze.

1226
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:32,042
On January 16th, 2012, the White House issued a statement saying

1227
01:16:32,042 --> 01:16:33,706
they didn't support the bill.

1228
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,776
and then this happened.

1229
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:39,866
I'm a big believer that we should be dealing with issues of piracy

1230
01:16:39,893 --> 01:16:42,040
and we should deal with them in a serious way

1231
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,337
but this bill is not the right bill.

1232
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:48,930
When Jimmy Wales put his support towards blacking out Wikipedia

1233
01:16:49,057 --> 01:16:52,666
the number 5 most popular website in the world

1234
01:16:52,773 --> 01:16:58,680
this is a website 7% of all of the clicks on anywhere on the Internet.

1235
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,110
Wikipedia went black,

1236
01:17:00,266 --> 01:17:01,580
Reddit went black,

1237
01:17:01,724 --> 01:17:02,970
Craigslist went black,

1238
01:17:03,306 --> 01:17:06,110
phonelines on Capitol Hill flat out melted,

1239
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,395
members of Congress started rushing to issue statements

1240
01:17:09,422 --> 01:17:12,960
retracting their support for the bill, that they were promoting just a couple of days ago.

1241
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,973
Within 24 hours the number of oponents of SOPA in Congress

1242
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:19,475
went from this...

1243
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:21,130
...to this.

1244
01:17:22,711 --> 01:17:27,697
To see Congressmen and Senators slowly flipside

1245
01:17:27,733 --> 01:17:31,244
throughout the day of blackout was pretty unbeliveable,

1246
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:34,080
there was like a hundered representatives swing,

1247
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:38,581
And that was when, as hard as it was for me to believe after all this

1248
01:17:38,581 --> 01:17:39,925
We had won!

1249
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,426
The thing everyone said was impossible,

1250
01:17:42,462 --> 01:17:48,540
that some of the biggest companies in the world had written of as kind of a pipe dream had happened.

1251
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:50,030
We did it!

1252
01:17:50,942 --> 01:17:52,275
We won!

1253
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:58,773
This is a historic week in Internet politics, maybe American politics.

1254
01:17:58,826 --> 01:18:02,488
The thing that we heard from people in Washington D.C,

1255
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:06,970
from staffers on Capitol Hill was, they recieved more e-mails and more phone calls

1256
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:10,462
on SOPA blackout day than they ever recieved about anything.

1257
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:12,928
I think that was an extremenly exciting moment,

1258
01:18:12,928 --> 01:18:17,770
this was the moment when the Internet had grown up politically.

1259
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,269
It was exhilarating because its hard to believe that it actually happened.

1260
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:25,470
It's hard to believe, a bill with so much financial power behind it

1261
01:18:25,893 --> 01:18:29,244
didn't simply sail through the Congress.

1262
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,298
and not only did it not sail through, it didn't pass at all.

1263
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,293
It's easy sometimes to feel like you are powerless

1264
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,060
like, when you come out on the streets and you march and you yell,

1265
01:18:39,075 --> 01:18:40,435
and nobody hears you.

1266
01:18:40,462 --> 01:18:43,057
But I'm here to tell you today: You are powerfull!

1267
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:48,550
Maybe sometimes you feel like you not being listened to,

1268
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:51,860
but I'm here to tell you that you are, that you are being listened to,

1269
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:56,405
You are making a difference. You can stop this bill if you dont stop fighting.

1270
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,404
Stop PIPA! Stop SOPA!

1271
01:19:04,444 --> 01:19:07,370
Some of the biggest Internet companies, to put it frankly, would benefit

1272
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,160
from a world in which the little competitors could get censored.

1273
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:14,040
We can't let that happen.

1274
01:19:15,114 --> 01:19:19,125
For him it was more important to be sure that you made a small change

1275
01:19:19,582 --> 01:19:22,640
than to play a small part in a big change.

1276
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:26,990
But SOPA was like playing a major part in a major change.

1277
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:30,008
and so for him it was kind of like his proof of concept.

1278
01:19:30,862 --> 01:19:34,540
Okay, you know, what I want to do with my life is to change the world.

1279
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:40,074
I think about it in this really scientific way of measuring my impact

1280
01:19:40,186 --> 01:19:42,310
and this shows that it is possible

1281
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,472
right, the thing that I want to do with my life is possible.

1282
01:19:46,044 --> 01:19:50,860
I have proved that I can do it. That I, Aaron Swartz, could change the world.

1283
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:56,352
For a guy who never really thought he had done much

1284
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:57,888
which was Aaron.

1285
01:19:59,381 --> 01:20:02,517
it was one of the few moments where you could really see

1286
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,848
that he felt like he had done something good.

1287
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:11,392
feeling like here is his maybe one and only victory lap.

1288
01:20:13,717 --> 01:20:16,341
Everyone said that there was on way could we stop SOPA.

1289
01:20:16,356 --> 01:20:22,025
We stopped it. This are 3 outrageously good victories and the year isn't over yet.

1290
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,194
I mean, if there is a time to be positive it's now.

1291
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,845
He wins SOPA a year after he is arrested.

1292
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:31,978
it's not an unambigously happy moment.

1293
01:20:31,978 --> 01:20:33,344
There is a lot going on.

1294
01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:40,149
He is so atuned towards participating in the political process, you can't stop him.

1295
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:44,350
The list of organizations Swartz founded or co-founded is enourmous.

1296
01:20:44,352 --> 01:20:48,256
and years before Edward Snowden would expose widespread Internet surveillance

1297
01:20:48,448 --> 01:20:50,737
Swartz was already concerned.

1298
01:20:50,737 --> 01:20:50,858
It is shocking to think that accountability is so lax
Swartz was already concerned.

1299
01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:54,622
It is shocking to think that accountability is so lax

1300
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,111
that they don't even have basic statistics

1301
01:20:57,137 --> 01:20:59,110
about how big this spying programme is.

1302
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,594
The answer is "We are spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them."

1303
01:21:03,594 --> 01:21:05,749
then thats an awful lot of people.

1304
01:21:06,602 --> 01:21:10,058
One thing that they said was "Look, we know number of telephones we are spying on,

1305
01:21:10,058 --> 01:21:12,868
we dont know exactly how many real people that corresponds to."

1306
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,349
but they came back and said we can't give you a number at all.

1307
01:21:15,386 --> 01:21:18,800
Thats pretty... I mean, that's scary is what it is.

1308
01:21:18,888 --> 01:21:25,730
And they put incredible pressure on him, took away .. all of the money he had made.

1309
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,807
they threatened to take away his physical freedom.

1310
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:34,293
Why did they do it? Why are they going after whistleblowers?

1311
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:38,337
Why are they going after people who tell the truth

1312
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:42,986
about all sorts of things from the banks

1313
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,190
to war, to just sort of government transparency.

1314
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:51,466
So secrecy serves those who are already in power, and we are living in an era of secrecy..

1315
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,408
That coincides with an era where the government is doing

1316
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,293
and also a lot of things that are probably illegal and unconstitutional.

1317
01:21:58,595 --> 01:22:01,520
So, those two things are not coincidences

1318
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,275
It's very clear that this technology has been developed

1319
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:07,351
not for small countries overseas, but right here

1320
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,920
for the use in United States by the US government.

1321
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,724
The problem with the spying programme is that its sort of long, slow expansion

1322
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,622
you kknow, going back to the Nixon Administration.

1323
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,920
Obviosly it became big after 9/11 under George W. Bush

1324
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:21,768
and Obama has continued to expand it

1325
01:22:21,848 --> 01:22:23,866
the problems have slowly grown worse and worse

1326
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:26,515
but there has been this moment you can point to and say

1327
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:30,970
"Okay we need to galvanize opposition today because today is when it matters."

1328
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,888
The prosecution, in my estimation, of Aaron Swartz

1329
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:41,230
was about sending a particular laser like message to a group of people

1330
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:45,504
that the Obama Administration sees as politically threatening

1331
01:22:47,422 --> 01:22:53,780
and that is the essentially the hacker, the information and the democracy activist community.

1332
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:57,306
and the message that the Obama Administration wanted to send

1333
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:00,800
to that particular community was in my estimation

1334
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:04,808
"we know you have the ability to make trouble for the establishment

1335
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,862
and so were going to try to make an example out of Aaron Swartz

1336
01:23:08,897 --> 01:23:13,600
to scare as many of you as possible into not making that trouble."

1337
01:23:13,706 --> 01:23:14,817
And the governement said

1338
01:23:14,888 --> 01:23:20,270
"oh, the legal opinions we are using to legalize the spying programme are also classified

1339
01:23:20,355 --> 01:23:23,448
so we can't even tell you which laws we are using to spy on you."

1340
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,533
Everytime they can say "Oh this is another instance of cyber war"

1341
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,440
"the cyber criminals are attacking us agian"

1342
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,360
"we are all in danger, we are all under threat".

1343
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:33,970
they use those as an excuse to push through more and more dangerous laws.

1344
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,897
Interviewer: Personally, how do you feel the fight is going?

1345
01:23:41,004 --> 01:23:42,890
It's up to you.

1346
01:23:47,635 --> 01:23:52,195
You know, there are sort of these two polarizing prespectives

1347
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,457
Everything is great, Internet has created all this freedom and liberty,

1348
01:23:55,457 --> 01:23:57,040
and everythings gonna be fantastic.

1349
01:23:57,084 --> 01:23:58,506
or everything is terrible.

1350
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:00,471
Internet has created all these tools for cracking down

1351
01:24:00,497 --> 01:24:03,370
and spying and, you know, controlling what we say.

1352
01:24:03,484 --> 01:24:05,310
and I think these both are true.

1353
01:24:06,293 --> 01:24:10,069
the Internet has done both and both are kind of amazing and astonishing

1354
01:24:10,097 --> 01:24:13,102
and which one will win out in the long run is up to us.

1355
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,635
It doesn't make sense to say "Oh one is doing better than the other"

1356
01:24:15,653 --> 01:24:17,620
you know, they are both true.

1357
01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:21,461
and its up to us which one we emphasize and which one we take advantage of

1358
01:24:21,711 --> 01:24:23,701
because they are both there and they are always gonna be there.

1359
01:24:29,184 --> 01:24:34,901
On September 12th, 2012, Federal prosecutors filed a superseeding indictment against Swartz

1360
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:40,256
adding additional counts of wire fraud, unauthorized access to a computer and Computer Fraud.

1361
01:24:40,506 --> 01:24:45,397
Now instead of 4 felony counts Swartz was facing 13.

1362
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,576
The prosecution leverage had dramatically increased

1363
01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:51,797
as did Swartz's potential jail time and fines.

1364
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:55,488
They filed a seperate indictment to add more charges

1365
01:24:55,738 --> 01:25:01,589
and they had a theory about why this conduct constituted a number of federal crimes

1366
01:25:01,839 --> 01:25:05,749
and that a very significant sentence could attach to it under the law.

1367
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:10,515
That theory and much of the prosecution case agianst Swartz

1368
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,857
involved a law created originally in 1986.

1369
01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:16,500
it is called "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.".

1370
01:25:16,885 --> 01:25:19,914
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was inspired by the movie "War Games"

1371
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:21,660
with Mathew Brodrick, which was a great movie,

1372
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:27,884
In this movie, a kid get the ability through the magic of computer networks

1373
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:30,257
to, like, launch a nuclear attack.

1374
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,706
Now that's not actually possible and certainly wasn't possible in the 80s

1375
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,613
but apparently this movie scared Congress enough

1376
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:44,960
to pass the original Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

1377
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,093
This is a law that is behind the times

1378
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:53,130
for example it penalises a Terms of Service kind of arrangements

1379
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:56,906
and something like eHarmony or match.com

1380
01:25:56,995 --> 01:26:01,400
and somebody sort of inflates their own personal characteristic

1381
01:26:01,431 --> 01:26:05,840
and all of a sudden depending on the jurisdiction and prosecutor they

1382
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,106
could be in whole host of troubles.

1383
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,389
We all know what Terms of Use are.

1384
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,555
Most people don't read them, but not abiding by their terms

1385
01:26:13,617 --> 01:26:16,300
could mean you are committing a felony.

1386
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:20,458
The website terms of service often say things like "Be nice to each other" or

1387
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,510
"dont do anything that's improper".

1388
01:26:22,604 --> 01:26:27,600
The idea that criminal law has anything to say about these kinds of violations

1389
01:26:27,697 --> 01:26:29,840
I think strikes most people as crazy.

1390
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:33,130
The examples even get even more crazy.

1391
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,202
Untill it was changed in March, 2013.

1392
01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:42,645
the Terms of Use on the website of Seventeen magzine said you had to be 18 in order to read it.

1393
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,720
I would say that the way CFAA has been interpreted by Justice Department

1394
01:26:46,764 --> 01:26:49,066
we are all probabaly breaking the law.

1395
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,082
Vague and prone to misuse CFAA has become "one size, fits all" hammer

1396
01:26:55,111 --> 01:26:57,790
for a wide range of computer related disputes.

1397
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:02,737
Though not the only factor in his case, 11 of 13 charges against Swartz

1398
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:05,111
involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

1399
01:27:07,351 --> 01:27:11,760
The question "Why?" hangs over much of the story of Aaron Swartz.

1400
01:27:11,946 --> 01:27:15,626
just what was motivating the goverment and what their case would have been

1401
01:27:16,204 --> 01:27:19,440
The Dept. of Justice declined requests for answers.

1402
01:27:19,637 --> 01:27:23,285
but Prof. Orin Kerr is a former prosecutor who has studied the case.

1403
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:27,937
I think I come about this case from a different direction than other people on a number of reasons.

1404
01:27:28,277 --> 01:27:32,437
I was a federal prosecutor at the justice department for 3 yrs before I started teaching.

1405
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:34,640
the government came forward with an indictment

1406
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:37,920
based on what crimes they thought were committed

1407
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,137
just as a purely lawyers matter, looking at the precedents

1408
01:27:41,164 --> 01:27:43,200
lookings at the statues, looking at history,

1409
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,484
looking at the cases that are out there so far

1410
01:27:45,697 --> 01:27:48,370
I think it was a fair indictment based on that.

1411
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,573
You can debate whether they should have charged this case.

1412
01:27:51,573 --> 01:27:52,768
There is just a lot of disagreement.

1413
01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:56,992
Some people are on Open Access side, some people are not.

1414
01:27:57,342 --> 01:28:03,260
I think the govt took Swartz's Guerilla Open Access Manifesto very seriously

1415
01:28:03,502 --> 01:28:09,810
and I think they saw him as somebody who was committed, as a moral imperative,

1416
01:28:09,813 --> 01:28:15,488
to breaking the law to overcome the law that Swartz saw as unjust

1417
01:28:15,488 --> 01:28:20,821
and in a democracy if you think a law is unjust there are ways of changing that law

1418
01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:24,725
there is, going to congress, as Swartz did so masterfully with SOPA

1419
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:28,458
or you can violate that law in order to nullify that law.

1420
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:32,512
And I think what was driving the prosecution was the sense

1421
01:28:32,762 --> 01:28:39,594
that Swartz was committed not just to breaking the law but really making sure that law was nullified.

1422
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:43,768
That everyone would have have access to the database in a way that

1423
01:28:43,804 --> 01:28:47,066
you couldn't put the toothpaste back into the tube

1424
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,400
it would be done and Swartz's side would win.

1425
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:55,893
There is a big disagreement in society as to whether that is an unjust law

1426
01:28:56,177 --> 01:29:00,130
and ultimately thats a decision for American people to make working through Congress.

1427
01:29:00,437 --> 01:29:03,680
and than the second problem is I think, we are still trying to figure out

1428
01:29:03,724 --> 01:29:07,600
what's the line between less serious offenses and more serious offenses.

1429
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:12,142
We are now entering that different environment of computers and computer misuse

1430
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:16,737
and we don't yet have a really strong sense of exactly what these lines are

1431
01:29:16,782 --> 01:29:18,440
because we are just woking that out.

1432
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:22,088
This is a poor use of prosecutorial discretion.

1433
01:29:22,204 --> 01:29:28,400
The hammer that the Justice Dept has to scare people with just gets bigger and bigger and bigger

1434
01:29:28,453 --> 01:29:32,970
and so most people, you know, can't role dice with your life like that

1435
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:35,660
Should we tap somebody's phone? Should we film them?

1436
01:29:35,688 --> 01:29:39,320
Should we turn somebody and get them to testify against these other people?

1437
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,421
That's how federal agents and prosecutors think.

1438
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:45,194
They build cases, they make cases.

1439
01:29:46,835 --> 01:29:49,964
Swartz was caught in the gears of brutal criminal justice system

1440
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,829
that could not turn back.

1441
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:56,880
A machine that has made America the country with the highest rate of incarceration in the world.

1442
01:29:57,084 --> 01:30:02,770
We have in this country allowed ourselves to be captured by the politics of fear and anger

1443
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:08,021
and anything we are afraid of, like the future of the Internet and access

1444
01:30:08,746 --> 01:30:11,925
and anything we are angry about instinctively creates

1445
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,580
a criminal justice intervention.

1446
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:17,182
and we have used jail, prison and punishment

1447
01:30:17,262 --> 01:30:21,173
to resolve whole host of problems that historically were never seen

1448
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,740
as criminal justice problem.

1449
01:30:22,906 --> 01:30:26,702
The impulse to threaten, indict, prosecute

1450
01:30:26,844 --> 01:30:32,780
which is part of what has created this debate and contorversy over online access and information on the Internet.

1451
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,477
It's very consistent with what we have seen in other areas

1452
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:40,284
one difference is people are usually targeted and victimized by

1453
01:30:40,328 --> 01:30:44,951
these kinds of criminal and carceral responses are typically poor and minority.

1454
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,382
Swartz's isolation from friends and family increased.

1455
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,155
He had basically stopped working on anything else.

1456
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:56,740
and the case was in fact taking over his whole life.

1457
01:30:56,888 --> 01:31:00,053
One of Aaron's lawyers apparently told the prosecutors that

1458
01:31:00,053 --> 01:31:02,702
he was emotionally vulnerable.

1459
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:06,830
and that was something they really needed to keep in mind, so that.. they knew that.

1460
01:31:06,906 --> 01:31:09,271
It was weighing on him very heavily

1461
01:31:09,324 --> 01:31:15,260
he did not like having his actions and movements restricted in any way

1462
01:31:15,514 --> 01:31:20,640
and threat of jail, which they pounded him with a lot

1463
01:31:22,097 --> 01:31:23,710
was terrifying to him.

1464
01:31:23,768 --> 01:31:26,871
Completley exhausted his financial resources and

1465
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:32,030
it cost us a lot of money also and he raised a substantial amount of money.

1466
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,680
So, you know, it was in millions of dollars.

1467
01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:38,197
Interviewer: The legal defence?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

1468
01:31:38,447 --> 01:31:40,288
Interviewer: Was it millions?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

1469
01:31:41,173 --> 01:31:44,950
Yea, I think he didn't want to be a burden to people. I think that was a factor

1470
01:31:45,207 --> 01:31:49,546
Like I have my normal life, and I have this shitty thing I have to deal with.

1471
01:31:49,582 --> 01:31:52,890
and I try to keep the two of them as seperate as possible.

1472
01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:57,184
But they were just begining to blur together and everything was becoming shitty.

1473
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:02,410
Swartz faced a tough choice that was only getting tougher.

1474
01:32:02,533 --> 01:32:06,740
To admit guilt and move on with your life or do you fight a broken system.

1475
01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:12,608
with his legal case the answer was simple. He rejects the final plea deal and a trial date is set.

1476
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:16,100
Aaron was resolute that he didn't want to knuckle under

1477
01:32:16,142 --> 01:32:18,810
and accept something that he didn't believe was fair

1478
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,949
but I also think that he was scared.

1479
01:32:32,789 --> 01:32:34,325
I don't think they would have convicted Aaron.

1480
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:38,540
I think we would have walked him out of that courthouse and I would have given him a big hug

1481
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:42,940
and we would have walked across that little river in Boston and gone and had a couple of beers.

1482
01:32:46,044 --> 01:32:47,653
I really thought that we were right.

1483
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:49,386
I thought we were gonna win the case.

1484
01:32:49,422 --> 01:32:51,130
I thought we could win the case.

1485
01:32:51,253 --> 01:32:55,840
He didn't talk about it very much but you could see the enourmous pain he was going through.

1486
01:33:01,162 --> 01:33:06,624
No time in his childhood did Aaron have any severe mood swings, or like depressive episodes

1487
01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:10,592
or anything that I would describe to as severe depression.

1488
01:33:10,842 --> 01:33:13,322
And it;s possible you know he was depressed, people get depressed

1489
01:33:18,702 --> 01:33:23,733
Very early in our relationship, like 3 or 4 weeks in or something,

1490
01:33:23,813 --> 01:33:29,960
I remember him saying to me that I was a lot stronger than he was.

1491
01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:36,362
you know, he was brittle in lot of ways, things were a lot harder for him than for a lot of people.

1492
01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:38,304
It was part of his brilliance too.

1493
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:46,666
I think, he probably had something like clinical depression in his early 20s

1494
01:33:47,484 --> 01:33:49,370
I don't think he did when I was with him.

1495
01:33:49,431 --> 01:33:53,770
He wasn't a joyful person.... but that's different from being depressed.

1496
01:33:56,364 --> 01:34:00,830
He was just under such such enourmous pressure for two years straight.

1497
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,816
He just didn't want to do it anymore.

1498
01:34:03,617 --> 01:34:07,290
He was just.. I think it was too much.

1499
01:34:14,213 --> 01:34:16,275
I got a phone call late at night.

1500
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:22,420
I could tell something was wrong and then I called and I realized what had happened.

1501
01:34:23,688 --> 01:34:28,970
The cofounder of the social news and entertainment website reddit has been found dead.

1502
01:34:29,075 --> 01:34:34,020
Police say 26 year old Aaron Swartz killed himself yesterday in his Brooklyn apartment.

1503
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:46,275
I just thought we've lost one of the most creative minds of our generation.

1504
01:34:46,444 --> 01:34:50,346
I was like the whole world fell apart at that moment.

1505
01:34:56,435 --> 01:34:59,310
It was one of the hardest nights of my life.

1506
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:03,910
It was like I was screaming "I can't hear you.. what did you just say.. I can't hear you."

1507
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:11,765
I can't. That's it.

1508
01:35:19,546 --> 01:35:23,710
None of it made any sense, and really still doesn't.

1509
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:27,480
I was so frustrated and angry.

1510
01:35:38,154 --> 01:35:41,120
You know I tried to explain it to my kids.

1511
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:46,325
My 3 yr old told me that the doctors would fix him.

1512
01:35:52,021 --> 01:35:56,160
I know lots of people who have died but I've never lost anybody like this.

1513
01:35:56,245 --> 01:36:03,050
Because everybody feels, and I do too, there is so much that we could've.. more to do.

1514
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:10,059
I just didn't know that he was there. I didn't know this is what he was suffering.

1515
01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:13,601
He was part of me.

1516
01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:19,328
And I just wanted it to not be real.

1517
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:27,989
And then I just looked at his Wikipedia page and I saw the end date.

1518
01:36:32,065 --> 01:36:34,944
02-02-2013

1519
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:44,871
Aaron is dead

1520
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:50,062
Wanderers in this crazy world,
we have lost a mentor, a wise elder.

1521
01:36:50,755 --> 01:36:54,017
Hackers for right, we are one down,

1522
01:36:54,257 --> 01:36:56,115
we have lost one of our own.

1523
01:36:57,057 --> 01:37:02,275
Nurturers, carers, listeners,
feeders, parents all,

1524
01:37:02,755 --> 01:37:04,933
we have lost a child.

1525
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:07,386
Let us all weep.

1526
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:17,953
My first thought was what if nobody even notices.

1527
01:37:18,805 --> 01:37:22,913
It wasn't clear to me how salient he was.

1528
01:37:23,818 --> 01:37:29,749
I had never seen anything quite like the outpouring I saw.

1529
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,242
The net just lit up.

1530
01:37:31,505 --> 01:37:35,600
Everyone was trying to explain it in their own way

1531
01:37:35,636 --> 01:37:39,883
but I have never seen people grieve on Twitter before.

1532
01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:42,549
People were visibily grieving online.

1533
01:37:46,465 --> 01:37:51,253
He was the Internet's Own Boy... and the whole world killed him.

1534
01:37:55,328 --> 01:38:00,277
We are standing in the middle of a time when great injustice is not touched.

1535
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,832
architects of financial meltdown have dinner with the President regularly.

1536
01:38:06,269 --> 01:38:09,992
in middle of that time the idea that this

1537
01:38:10,516 --> 01:38:12,669
was what the government had to prosecute

1538
01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:17,642
it just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.

1539
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:23,221
The question is can we do something, given what's happened,

1540
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,220
to make the world a better place.

1541
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:30,485
And how can we further that legacy. Thats the only question one can ask.

1542
01:38:33,061 --> 01:38:37,229
All over the world there are starting to be hackathons, gatherings

1543
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:42,101
and Aaron Swartz has in some sense brought the best out us

1544
01:38:42,232 --> 01:38:45,030
in trying to say "how do we fix this".

1545
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,341
He was in my humble opinion one of the true

1546
01:38:50,356 --> 01:38:54,480
extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced

1547
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:59,250
I don't know weather Aaron was defeated or victorious, but

1548
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:04,270
we are certainly shaped by the hand of the things

1549
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:05,877
that he wrestled with.

1550
01:39:06,127 --> 01:39:08,692
When we turned armed agents of the law

1551
01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:12,192
on citizens trying to increase access to knowledge

1552
01:39:12,442 --> 01:39:14,133
we've broken the rule of law

1553
01:39:14,383 --> 01:39:16,778
and we've desecrated the temple of justice.

1554
01:39:17,028 --> 01:39:19,530
Aaron Swartz was not a criminal.

1555
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,309
Change does not role in on the wheels..

1556
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:25,390
.. of inevitability.

1557
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:25,440
It comes through continous struggle.
.. of inevitability.

1558
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,700
It comes through continous struggle.

1559
01:39:30,026 --> 01:39:31,690
Aaron really could do magic

1560
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,900
and I am dedicated to making sure...

1561
01:39:34,095 --> 01:39:35,936
... his magic doesn't end with his death.

1562
01:39:36,186 --> 01:39:37,664
He believed that he could change the world.

1563
01:39:37,914 --> 01:39:39,498
And he was right.

1564
01:39:39,748 --> 01:39:42,549
Out of the last week, and out of today..

1565
01:39:42,799 --> 01:39:44,832
.. phoenixes are already rising.

1566
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:51,637
Since Swartz's death Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Sen. Ron Wyden..

1567
01:39:51,887 --> 01:39:53,536
have introduced legislations that would reform

1568
01:39:53,786 --> 01:39:55,370
... the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

1569
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,741
The outdated law that formed the majority of the charges..

1570
01:39:58,991 --> 01:39:59,936
against Swartz.

1571
01:40:00,186 --> 01:40:02,389
It's called "Aaron's Law."

1572
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,802
Aaron believed that like you literally ought to..

1573
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:07,424
.. be asking yourself all the time..

1574
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:11,157
.. "what is the most thing i could be working on in the world right now?"

1575
01:40:11,407 --> 01:40:13,269
And if you are not working on that, why aren't you?

1576
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:37,098
I wish we could change the past, but we cannot.

1577
01:40:37,348 --> 01:40:43,605
But we can change the future and we must. We must do so for Aaron. We must do so for ourselves.

1578
01:40:43,855 --> 01:40:48,469
We must do so to make our world a better place.. a more humane place.

1579
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,304
A place where justice works.

1580
01:40:50,554 --> 01:40:54,272
And access to knowledge becomes a human right.

1581
01:40:54,522 --> 01:40:59,413
So there was a kid, back in feburary from Baltimore.

1582
01:40:59,663 --> 01:41:01,504
14 years old.

1583
01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:08,352
..who had access to JStor and he had been splunking through JStor after reading something.

1584
01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:13,365
And he figured out a way to do early tests for Pancreatic Cancer.

1585
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,037
And Pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you.

1586
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:22,560
Because we detect it way to late. By the time we detect its already too late to do anything about that.

1587
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:28,725
And, he sent e-mails off to entire Oncology department at John Hopkins..

1588
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:31,434
you know hundereds of them.
Interviewer: A 14 year old?

1589
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,610
14 year old kid yeah. And most of them ignored it.

1590
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,594
But one of them, like, sent him a e-mail back

1591
01:41:35,844 --> 01:41:38,100
And said, "this is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over."

1592
01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:43,189
This kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher and in Feburary I heard him on the news..

1593
01:41:43,466 --> 01:41:46,794
.. just couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot.

1594
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,200
Sorry.

1595
01:41:53,344 --> 01:41:58,997
And he said, the reason he was on the news is because they had done it.

1596
01:41:59,247 --> 01:42:03,200
They were shipping an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives.

1597
01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:07,744
And he said, "This is why what Aaron did was so important."

1598
01:42:10,496 --> 01:42:12,224
Because you never know, right.

1599
01:42:12,245 --> 01:42:17,024
This truth of the universe is not only something that policy makers use to figure out...

1600
01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,029
.. you know, what the speed limit should be.

1601
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:25,258
Its where the things thats gonna keep, your kid from dying of Pancreatic cancer comes from.

1602
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:31,146
And, without access the person who might come up with the thing thats got your

1603
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:34,901
number on it may never find that answer.

1604
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:47,525
[?]

1605
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:50,534
Very good, Aaron, very good!

1606
01:42:51,113 --> 01:42:56,890
Okay! Now it's [?] time
